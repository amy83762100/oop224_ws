After finish this Workshop, I now have a better understanding of the "rule of three." 

In the beginning, I didn't understand how to copy and assign the basic class in the derived class. When I first time test my code, I realize that the "m_content" and "m_filename" class members of the "H3" object are point to a "nullptr", which means the "H2" object assign only the derived class content to the "H3" object. 

To solve this problem, I add the basic class's assign operator - "Text::operator=(source);" to the function.
