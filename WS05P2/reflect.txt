After finishing this workshop, I now know how to define and create member operator,  conversion operator, helper operator, and grant a helper function friendship status. 

I think the most difficult part is helper operators. In the last part of part 1, we need to create a binary stand-alone helper += operator that accepts a double reference at left and a constant account reference at right and returns a double value. In the beginning, I was not sure whether I should grant friendship to a helper function to allows the function to access the private members of the Account class. Therefore, I decided to read the course note again. According to the course note, I now know that granting friendship can reduce class bloat, but it will also pierce encapsulation. Therefore, we grant friendship only to helper functions that require both read and write access to the private data members.
